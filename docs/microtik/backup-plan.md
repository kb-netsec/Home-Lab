# Microtik Backup Plan

I need a plan to backup Microtik configurations. Since the encryption built into RouterOS is weak, (see RouterOS manual Backup section) 
my plan is to back up binary and text files via a secure method (SFTP if possible) to a Linux host on my LAN where it will be encrypted with GPG. 

TO DO: 
Document execution
